## Lehigh Undergraduate College Distribution by Percent (2024)

In the academic year beginning in the Fall of 2024, the undergraduate student population was determined to be comprised of seven distinct groups corresponding to their program and college. One of these groups is not represented on the infographic, as I feel the data is insignificant and unclear. Because of this, 0.2% is taken out and put under the label "other". 

I decided to present the data from largest to smallest so that viewers can better visualize the distribution of students among the various colleges. This data was taken from the [Office of Institutional Data](https://data.lehigh.edu/sites/data.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2024.pdf) at Lehigh University.

## Are College Students in the U.S. Environmentally Conscious?

In a 2023 sample survey covering all 50 states and the District of Columbia, researchers measured the environmental opinions of Americaâ€™s youth. The survey consisted of 80.5% 18-25 year olds, college-aged students, and 19.5% 16-17 year olds. The survey had around an equal number of males and females and included a wide range of demographics to have a true representation of the college-aged population. 

This infographic depicts multiple results of the survey that I feel are most important to share with other college-aged individuals. I illustrated the percentages through pie charts to provide concrete visuals of the majority, and put images of a few of America's ecosystems to depict the topic of the survey.

## The Search for Cleopatra's Final Resting Place 

This timeline shows the journey of the expedition to discover the long-lost tomb of the infamous Queen Cleopatra of Egypt. In this timeline, I highlighted the most crucial elements of the search, which has been over a decade long, giving a short yet comprehensive summary of the project. The pictures and information are taken from primary resources, besides the first image, sourced from Wikipedia, to enhance the authenticity.
